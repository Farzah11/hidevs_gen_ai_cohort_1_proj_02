Report: Question Answering System with RAG
This report breaks down the components of a Q&A system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here's a simplified explanation of why each method is used.

1. Document Loaders
We use different loaders to handle various file formats like PDFs, CSVs, DOCX, and Excel. Each format needs a specific way to read its contents:

PDF Loader: Extracts text from PDF pages.
CSV Loader: Handles structured data like spreadsheets.
DOCX Loader: Reads text from Word documents.
Excel Loader: Processes Excel files similarly to CSVs.
This ensures the system can work with multiple file types efficiently.

2. Text Splitter
The Recursive Character Text Splitter breaks the document into smaller chunks. This is necessary because large text blocks are harder for models to process. The overlap between chunks ensures important information isn’t lost.

3. Embeddings
Embeddings convert text into numerical form so the machine can understand it. We use Grok Embeddings because they capture the meaning of the text accurately, ensuring the system can match the right document chunks to user questions.

4. Vector Store
We store these embeddings in Pinecone, a database that quickly retrieves the most relevant chunks. Pinecone is fast and handles large data efficiently, making it perfect for storing embeddings.

5. Large Language Model (LLM)
We use Groq's LLM to generate answers based on the retrieved text. This model is good at understanding language and crafting responses that are clear and human-like.

6. Query Retrieval
We create variations of the user’s query to ensure better search results. This increases the accuracy of the system when finding relevant information.

7. RAG Pipeline
The pipeline works in two parts:

Retrieval: Finds relevant chunks of the document using Pinecone.
Generation: The LLM creates an answer based on these chunks.
In short, the system reads, processes, and retrieves information efficiently to answer user questions based on real document content.
